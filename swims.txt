Alligators are very strong swimmers, and they can also hold their breaths underwater for a really long time! So they are basically killing machines in the water. If you think you are safe if you encounter an alligator on land, however, you are so, so wrong. They can run really fast too. They're not great at switching direction, however. If an alligator is chasing you, try running away in a switch-back, zig-zag pattern. You might have better odds.
